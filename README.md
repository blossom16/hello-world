# hello-world
just do it
I go by Mera with friends and family and Maria at work/school.  Mera brings out my fun and mischievious side while my Maria identity is passive, judgmental, and extremely negative.  I hope I can make Mera my identity in all settings, I feel that it would help me be more couragous and creative in all aspects of my life.
